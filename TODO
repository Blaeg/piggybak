# MUST / Client Driven
# Figure out how to make entire payments section Read Only after it's completed (Discuss with railsadmin ppl)
# Troubleshoot, figure out why subclasseses isn't working on payment_methods, tax_methods, shipping_methods
# Add countries: migration, associations, RailsAdmin DSL, add to checkout page, but don't do anything with countries - states toggle yet
# Add United States to seed data
# Add states to seed data

# Nice to have, at some point
# Remove requirement to update app/models/ability.rb to include Piggybak models
# - check if defined: extend
# - else not defined: include default
# Decide if line items should become read only after they are shipped
# Add testing :)
